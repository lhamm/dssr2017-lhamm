### Team Charter (project specific)
##Project definition
###Project name
Digital skills for better acuity measures
###Vision
Apply digital skills learned in the course to find ways to better assess children's vision in community settings
###Mission
Use matlab to analyse an existing data set, and suggest revisions for phase two of testing
###Success criteria (measurable)
A completed analysis program by end of course


##Team agreement
###Behavioural agreement
* collaborative work
* respectful interactions
* opportunity for creative thinking

###Communication agreement
* daily reporting
* identifying barriers to meeting goals


##Possible questions to guide goal setting:
* How many children could be tested, and what were the reasons for missing results?
* What were the acuity results for tested children?
* What are ways of determining how reliable those results are? (bootstrapping, comparing regular to vanishing)
* What do these methods tell us about the reproducability of the results?
* What proportion of time did the distance tracking work in real time (frame by frame, and participant by participant)?
* What proportion of time (frame by frame, or test by test) was the tested eye incorrect? How many of these were identified in real time?
* In these cases, would using distance/eye data have changed the acuity results for the child? 
* What are the different reasons why distance tracking or eye tracking didn't work?
* How can we optomise the current image analysis software to improve the effeciency of the real time analysis?
* With the image data from this project, how reliable could we be if we implemented optomisation?
* Could we be accurate enough with this approach to use provide feedback during a community eye exam?
